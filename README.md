# The Agency Issues & Feedback

Welcome to the official feedback hub for The Agency! This repository is for reporting bugs and suggesting new features for the game. This space is for your input and I'll read everything posted to improve the game.

## How to Contribute
1. **Play the Game:** Try it out here: https://the-agency.joshse.com.
2. **Report a Bug or Suggest a Feature:**
   - Click the **"Issues"** tab above.
   - Choose **"New Issue"** and pick either "Bug Report" or "Feature Request."
   - Fill out the form with as much detail as possible—screenshots or videos help!
3. **Check Existing Issues:** See if someone’s already mentioned your idea or issue before submitting.

## Guidelines
- Be specific (e.g., “The jump button lags in Chrome” vs. “Game is broken”).
- No spam or off-topic posts—they will be locked or removed.
- This isn’t for code contributions—just feedback. If you'd like to contribute to the code, send me an email at josh@archefire.com.

Thanks for helping improve The Agency!
